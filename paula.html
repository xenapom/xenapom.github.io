<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Biography</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">
My name is Paula Heikkinen. I am a 37 year old biologist from Finland, currently located in Zuerich, Switzerland. I got my Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Helsinki and decided after that to move into GIS and  get my Master of Science in this field.
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">One of my goals is to learn a bit about programming and be able to use it in various GIS analysis tools and projects in the future. I have not been involved with programming before, so this course is quite exciting for me to do.  
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Python course Portfolio</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">
The links to the Python course assignments can be found below.
They include the Agent-based modelling assignment and the Black Death programming work (Assignment 2).
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Agent based modelling code</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">
The code I created for the Agent-Based Modelling Practical can be found in the link 
  <a href=abm.zip>here</a>. 
  It includes the final practical work including the graphics and the Agent class with its functions.
</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">
The code features the model itself in the model.py source code file. Additionally there is the agentframework.py, which contains the agent framework itself including the Agent class that is the core of the model. The model is the code that is started and initialises the agents by adding them to a list of agents. 
</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">
As I have very little previous knowhow of programming and of HTML and web-page creating, 
  I had to use quite a lot of time to understand the logic and the how coding actually 
  works as well as getting a basic understanding of HTML. I struggled specifically with 
  understanding the lists and how to handle them, especially when there were lists within 
  lists and how to correctly address the right item. Getting the loops and iterations 
  somewhat correct was also quite tricky at first. 
</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">
I did not quite understand the graphics libraries and how to get the animation working and being able to display it. Using the code that I created in the exercise did not show the animation in the output window, so I was a bit perplexed on how to sort that out.
I did some research on how to use the matplotlib and found the save-function, which can be used to save the output
of the iterations as a file. 
  I saved it as an html file in the same output directory as the rest of the code, but commented out the code. 
  However, I also uploaded the file to GitHub in the main directory.
  When opening the file <a href=abm.html>abm.html</a>, it can be played to show the agents in work.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Black Death Assignment code</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">
The code I created for the Assignment 2 - Black Death can be found in the link 
  <a href=bd.zip>here</a>. 
  It contains the source code file bd_model.py, the csv files that are read, as well as the output txt file and the 
  Software Documentation Word document including the UML Diagram for the assignment.

The code features the model itself in the model.py source code file. Additionally there is the agentframework.py, which contains the agent framework itself including the Agent class that is the core of the model.
